In this file let us see how to do basic things with Externally Owned Accounts using Command line
We will work on the below mentioned tasks:
 --> How to Create a new EOA?
 --> How to list all the EOAs?
 --> How to update(change the password) an EOA?
 --> How to check the balance of an EOA?
 --> How to check the balance of all the EOAs?

 *****************************************************************************************************************

 --> How to Create a new EOA?
 A)  To create a new account using geth client we need to issue below command.

           geth --datadir "/path/to/chaindata" account new

    After issuing the above command it will prompt us to give a passphrase. We need to remember this passphrase to unlock this
    account in order to make transactions from this account.

  --> How to list all the EOAs?
  A)  To list all the EOAs we need to issue the below command in the geth client

          geth --datadir "/path/to/chaindata" account list

      This command list all the accounts with their creation date , time and keyfile paths.

    We can list the accounts by using geth Javascript console. To list the accounts using geth Javascript console we need to issue
    the below Command
                               eth.accounts()
    eth.accounts() returns an array of all the accounts


  --> How to update(change the password) an EOA?
  A) To update an account, we need to use geth client. In geth client we need to issue the following Command
        geth --datadir "/path/to/chaindata" account update [we need to provide account address here]

      once we issue this command to the geth client, geth will prompt for a password we need to provide current password.
      once we issue current password it asks for a new password and then the account will be updated successfully.

  --> How to check Balance of an EOA?
  A) To check balance of an EOA we need to issue the below mentioned command from the geth console.

          eth.getBalance(account address)
        we need to provide account address of the EOA for which we need to query the account balance.
        This above function returns account balance in Wei which is the lowest denomination of ether. (1 ether = 1* 10**18 wei)
        to get the balance in terms of ether we need to use

          web3.fromWei(balance)

  --> How to check Balance of all the EOAs?
  A)  Normally Ethereum works in asynchronous mode. So we can write JS callbacks in Ethereum. So to query balance of all the Accounts
      let us write a js function.

      function Check(){
.. web3.eth.getAccounts(function(err,accounts){
........ accounts.forEach(function(id){
.............. web3.eth.getBalance(id,function(err,balance){
.................... console.log("" + id + ":\t balance : " + web3.fromWei(balance,"ether")+ "ether");
.................... });
.............. });
........ });
.. };

      Once we call this function we will get the Balance of all the accounts in the denomination of ether.
